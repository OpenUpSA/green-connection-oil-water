Governments may be willing to underwrite loans to gain foreign investment and secure jobs, but end up with useless infrastructure producing oil, gas and coal products based on outdated technology.. Not only that, but they will have missed opportunities to invest in renewables. Global Energy Watch estimates that up to $245 billion of investments in gas alone could end up as “stranded assets”, and that “Emerging petrostates are setting up their industries at the worst possible time“. Even worse, the rush to secure natural gas following the invasion of Ukraine and introduction of sanctions against Russia has led to an oversupply in the market. By effectively subsidising the production of fossil fuels, governments are increasing the chances that they will end up in a debt trap. The spot price of gas today is 80% less than it was two years ago."
